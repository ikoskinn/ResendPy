# ResendPy
Python bot created on Telethon, can forward messages from another channels to yours.


# HOW TO USE

1. You need to get your API_ID and API_HASH on https://my.telegram.org/auth . You need to create an app for it.
2. Match your API_ID and API_HASH in variables in main.py
3. Bot needs your channel's username to forward messages there. Set your channel's username in 'channelToName' variable.
4. Start bot and enter your Telegram's account phone number, without '+' symbol and enter code from Telegram in command line.
5. Last thing you need is to write password you set, default is '5051'. DONE. You can forward messages to your channel.

- You can add channels for forwarding, just send them by '@'. Example: @username or you can send multiple channels just split them by enter key.
- You can delete channels you've added. Just send to account '/del', then send usernames of channels.
